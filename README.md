# SDN-Network-Optimization
This project demonstrates a Software Defined Network (SDN) simulation using the Ryu SDN Controller and Mininet. The simulation optimizes traffic routing in a network topology by dynamically configuring flows based on topology discovery and traffic patterns.

# Installation and Setup:

Mininet: A network emulator for creating virtual topologies.
Install Mininet:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mininet

Ryu SDN Controller: A framework for developing SDN applications.
Install Ryu:
pip install ryu

Python Libraries:
networkx (for topology graph analysis)
pip install networkx
